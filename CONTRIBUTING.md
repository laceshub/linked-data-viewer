## How to report a bug

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down
