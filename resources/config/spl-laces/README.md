# Configuration: spl-laces

This is the SPL Laces configuration for the Laces Linked Data Viewer.

This configuration is a template for displaying Specification Libraries (or SPLs) that have been captured according to the corresponding Laces data vocabulary. The hierarchy in the viewer is configured to display top concepts and the resources classified as these concepts. Upon opening a resource for viewing, the user is presented with an information pane on that specific resource. Please specify a location and/or access mechanism to the desired SPL in the `config.json` file before using this configuration.
