# Configuration: default

This is the default configuration for the Laces Linked Data Viewer.

It is configured to use Wikidata as its source through its public query endpoint. The hierarchy in the viewer is configured to display the taxonomy (i.e., the hierarchy of "subclass of" relations) that is located under the Wikidata concept called "collective entity" (wd:Q99527517). Upon opening a concept for viewing, the user is presented with an information pane on that specific concept.
