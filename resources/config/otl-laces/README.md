# Configuration: otl-laces

This is the OTL Laces configuration for the Laces Linked Data Viewer.

This configuration is a template for displaying Object Type Libraries (or OTLs) that have been captured according to the corresponding Laces data vocabulary. The hierarchy in the viewer is configured to display the taxonomy (i.e., the hierarchy of "subclass of" relations). Upon opening a resource for viewing, the user is presented with an information pane on that specific resource. Please specify a location and/or access mechanism to the desired OTL in the `config.json` file before using this configuration.
